## Installation

``` bash
# clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/dev-esakki/React-Frontend.git my-project

# go into app's directory
$ cd my-project

# install app's dependencies
$ npm install
```

## Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)


### Basic usage

``` bash
# dev server  with hot reload at http://localhost:3000
$ npm start
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Build

Run `build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `build/` directory.

```bash
# build for production with minification
$ npm run build
```

### Environmental Files

```bash
.env.development => for development

.env.staging => for staging

.env.production => for production

every variable must be prefixed with (REACT_APP_)

(ex..) REACT_APP_API_URl=[http://localhost:5000]

Bind this value in any part of the application by using node.js process command {process.env.REACT_APP_API_URl}
```
